Don't touch the sleeping pills, they mess with my head
Dredging up Great White Sharks, swimming in the bed
And here comes a Killer Whale, to sing me to sleep
Thrashing the covers off, it was me by its teeth
And oh my love remind me, what was it that I said?
I can't help but pull the earth around me, to make my bed
And oh my love remind me, what was it that I did?
Did I drink too much?\nAm I losing touch?\nDid I build this ship to wreck?
What's with the long face? Do you want more?
Thousands of red-eyed mice, scratching at the door
Don't let the curtain catch you, 'cause you've been here before
The chair is an island darling, you can't touch the floor
And good Good, under starless skies we are lost
I was on a heavy tip\nTrying to cross a canyon with a broken limb
You were on the other side\nLike always, wondering what to do with life
I'd already had a sip\nSo I reasoned I was drunk enough to deal with it
You were on the other side\nLike always, you could never make your mind
And with one kiss\nYou inspired a fire of devotion\nThat lasts for twenty years
What kind of man loves like this?
To let me dangle at a cruel angle\nOh my feet don't touch the floor
Sometimes you're half in and then you're half out\nBut you never close the door
What kind of man?
You're a holy fool all colored blue\nRed feet upon the floor
You do such damage, how do you manage\nTo have me crawling back for more?
But I can't beat you\n'Cause I'm still with you
"Oh mercy", I implore
How do you do it? I think I'm through\nThen I'm back against the wall
Between a crucifix and the Hollywood sign, we decided to get hurt
Now there's a few things we have to burn\nSet our hearts ablaze
And every city was a gift
And every skyline was like a kiss upon the lips
And I was making you a wish\nAnd every skyline
How big, how blue, how beautiful
And meanwhile a man was falling from space
And everyday I wore your face\nLike an atmosphere around me\nA satellite beside me
As he hit the earth I left this place
Let the atmosphere surround me\nA satellite beside me
What are we gonna do?\nWe've opened the door now it's all coming through
Tell me you see it too\nWe've opened our eyes and it's changing the view
So much time on the other side\nWaiting for you to wake up
Maybe I'll see you in another life\nIf this one wasn't enough
Oh, the king\nGone made within his suffering
Called out for relief\nSomeone cure him of his grief
His only son, cut down but the battle won
Oh, what is it worth?\nWhen all that's left is hurt
Like the stars chase the sun\nOver the glowing hill, I will conquer
Blood is running deep\nSomethings never sleep
Suddenly I'm overcome
Dissolving like the setting sun
Like a boat into oblivion
'Cause you're driving me away
Now you have me on the run\nThe damage is already done
Come on, is this what you want?\n'Cause you're driving me away?
Oh, the queen of peace\nAlways does her best to please
Oh, the queen of peace\nAlways does her best to please
Is it any use?\nSomebody's got to lose
Like a long scream\nOut there always echoing
And my love is no good\nAgainst the fortress that it made of you
Blood is running deep\nSorrow that you keep
And the air was full\nOf various storms and saints
So I gave myself over willingly\nYou got a hold on me
I don't know how I don't just sand outside and scream
I am teaching myself how to be free
The monument of a memory\nYou tear it down in your head
Don't make the mountain your enemy
You saw the stars out in front of you\nToo tempting not to touch
Even though it shocked you\nSomething's electric in your blood
Can people just untie themselves?
Uncurling like flowers
While all around you, the buildings sway\nSing it out loud "Who made us this way?"
Hold on to your heart\nYou'll keep it safe
Hold on to your heart\nDon't give it away
I know it seems like forever\nI know it seems like an age\nBut one day this will be over, I swear it's not so far away
Drifting through the halls with the sunrise
(Holding on for your call)
Climbing up the walls for that flashing light
(I can never let go)
'Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
'Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine\n(Maybe not tonight)
Now the sun is up and I'm going blind
Another drink just to pass the time
It's a different kind of danger\nAnd the bells are ringing out
And I'm calling for my mother\nAs I pull the pillars down
It's a different kind of danger\nAnd my feet are spinning round
Never knew I was a dancer\n'Till Delilah showed me how
Too fast for freedom
Too fast for freedom\nSometimes it all falls down
These chains never leave me\nI keep dragging them around
Now I'm dancing with Delilah and her vision is mine
A different kind of danger in the daylight
Took anything to cut you, I can find
Now it's one more boy and it's one more lie
Taking the pills just to pass the time\n(I can never say no)
Strung up, strung out for your love
Hang in, hung up, it's so rough
I'm wrung and ringing out
Why can't you let me know?
Is it too late to come on home?
Are all those bridges now old stone?
Can the city forgive? I hear its sad song
It's been so long between the words we spoke
It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do\nTo try and keep from calling you
Well, can my dreams keep coming true?
How can they?\n'Cause when they sleep, I never dream of you
As if the dream of you, it sleeps too\nBut it never slips away
And I'm caught
I'm forgetting all that I've been taught
I can't keep calm, I can't keep still
Pulled apart against my will
You turn to salt as I turn around to look at you
It's hard to see it when you're in it\n'Cause I went blind for you
And I was thrashing on the line
Somewhere between\nDesperate and divine
That original lifeline
Hey look up!\nDon't make a shadow of yourself, always shutting out the light
Caught in your own creation
Look up look up!\nIt tore you open\nAnd oh, how much!
'Cause there's a hole where your heart lies\nAnd I can see it with my third eye
And oh my touch, it magnifies\nYou pull away, you don't know why
Hey look up!\nYou don't have to be a ghost\nHere amongst the living
You are flesh and blood!\nAnd you deserve to be loved\nAnd you deserve what are given
'Cause your pain is a tribute\nThe only thing you let hold you
Wear it now like a mantle\nAlways there to remind you
I'm the same, I'm the same, I'm trying to change
St. Jude, the patron saint of lost causes
St. Jude, we were lost before she started
St. Jude, we lay in bed as she whipped around us
St. Jude, maybe I've ben always more comfortable in chaos
Oh Lord, won't you leave me?\nLeave me on my knees?
'Cause I belong to the ground now\nAnd it belongs to me
Oh Lord, won't you leave me?\nLeave me just like this?
'Cause I belong to the ground now\nI want no more than this
How I long for the autumn
The sun keeps burning me
Every stone in this city keeps reminding me
Can you protect me from what I want?\nThe love I let in, left me so lost
Mother, make me\nMake me a big tall tree\nSo I can shed my leaves and let it blow through me
Mother, make me\nMake me a big grey cloud\nSo I can rain on you things I can't say out loud
All these couples are kissing\nAnd I can't stand the heat
No use wishing on the water\nIt'll grant you no relief
Mother, make me\nMake me a bird of prey\nSo I can rise above this, let it fall away
Mother, make me\nMake me a song so sweet\nHeaven trembles, fallen at our feet
I never thought I'd be a killer\n'Cause there's so much to lose
But if I can't drink the water\nWhat else can I do?
Although the axe is heavy\nIt just sits in my hands
Every time I try to bring it down\nYou always turn my head around
Make up your mind
Let me leave or let me love you
The power is on, the guillotine hums
My back's to the wall - go on, let it fall 
The executioner's within me\nAnd he comes blindfold ready
Sword in hand
And arms so steady
And it's my whole heart\nWeighed and measured inside
And it's an old scar
And it's my whole heart\nDeemed and delivered a crime
I'm on trial, waiting 'till the beat comes out
Who's a heretic now?
How can you make it stick?
Waiting 'till the beat comes out
Who's a heretic, child?
I'm miles away, he's on my mind
I'm getting tired of crawling all the way
I've had enough, it's obvious
I'm not beat up by this yet
You can't tell me to regret
Been in the dark since the day we met
Fire help me to forget!
And it's my whole heart\nWhile tried and tested, it's mine
And it's my whole heart\nTrying to bleach it out
Chained and shackled, oh
I'll unravel, oh
It's a pity, oh
And it's my whole heart\nWhile tried and tested, it's mine
And it's my whole heart\nTrying to bleach it out
Chained and shackled, oh
I'll unravel, oh
It's a pity, oh
